## This is a Quote Machine  
### Inspired in a Drum Machine Project and in [Gwen](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/gwen/#:~:text=Gwen%20hurls%20a%20needle%20that,to%20unlock%20the%20next%20one.)

This project is a more complete version of [another project](https://github.com/jvitoralb/Drum-Machine-FCC) I did for freeCodeCamp.

And that's because fcc's test in this project, the way I did it, with more features caused an error.

So this project is a Drum machine, but when you click the pads a quote from Gwen - The Hallowed Seamstress, a League Of Legends character is played.  
In this project, I used JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Sass.
